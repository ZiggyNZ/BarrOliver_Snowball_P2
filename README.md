# Snowball
Snowball is a Marble Madness inspired co-operative platform/puzzle game.

## Outline:
The game is mechanically simple, player 1 (pink) has the ability to jump, and player 2 (blue) has the ability to dash. Player 1 typically excels at getting up high, while player 2 excels at using speed to jump really far or avoid obstacles. 

The level structure is relatively linear, the entire map travels in one direction and each branching path is painted with each players respective colour.

App has been built to support Windows and Mac. It can be found under Snowball/Snowball.app.

The most techinically challenging part is getting the controls down. This includes understading the physhics, and how each players ability functions.
